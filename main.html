            <p>Talented people are the foundation of every successful company and startup in history.<br>
                <br>
                The best companies view people as a core, ongoing strategy and foster a culture of hiring as a way to complement skills and catalyse behaviours.<br>
                <br>
                These are the companies that reach the tallest peaks.<br>
                <br>
                The companies that fail don’t do so because of a lack of ambition or vision, but as the result of poor execution.<br>
                <br> 
                <b>It’s like embarking on a journey without a map.</b><br>
                <br>
                In practice, having a map means having a predictable, scalable system in place for every step of the recruiting and hiring journey - from sourcing & interviewing, compensation & benefits to onboarding & retention.<br>
                <br>
                There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to recruiting and each company develops their own process to align with their unique culture.<br>
                <br>
                Having a clearly defined hiring process can help early startups avoid costly and destabilising hiring mistakes.<br>
                <br>
                This guide will provide you with the roadmap to successful hiring and support your every step of your recruiting journey.<br>
                <br>
                Whether it’s sourcing only the right people or convincing a high-quality candidate to join your early-stage team, you’ll know the right move. Here you have a high-level breakdown of an end-to-end recruiting process for early hires.<br>
                —
                <br>
                It might not be easy, but with careful attention, you can make sure your first hires help you find Product-Market Fit and shape a great culture in your company from the start, for years to come.<br>
                <br>
                This Field Guide, together with the documentation enclosed, is exactly what you need to start recruiting your BEST FOUNDING TEAM.<br>
